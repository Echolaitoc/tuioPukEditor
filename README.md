# tuioPukEditor
Abandoned editor to create description files of trackable physical objects for capacitive touch screens.

The idea was to measure the contact points distance to each other and save them to XML files so other applications could read those files to identify the physical objects when they are placed on a capacitive touchscreen.
This project is unfinished and has been abandoned.
